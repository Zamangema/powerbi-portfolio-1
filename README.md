Retail Sales Performance Dashboard
I designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize product sales across regions and categories for a retail company. The report includes bar and line charts, KPIs, and dynamic slicers for product categories, regions, and date ranges. This project demonstrates my ability to clean data, build professional visuals, and provide actionable business insights using Power BI. It also reflects my strong foundation in data storytelling and dashboard design.
